There are the standard (or base) packages which are part of the source code - the functions and data sets that make up these packages are automatically available when R is opened. There are also many contributed packages. These have been written by many different authors, often to implement methods that are not available in the base packages. If you are unable to find a method in the base packages, you might be able to find it in a contributed package. The Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) site (http://cran.r-project.org/) is where many contributed packages can be downloaded. Click on packages on the left hand side. We will download two packages in this class using the install.packages command and we then load the package into R using the library command.\nAlternatively, in RStudio click on the Packages tab &gt; Install &gt; type in package name &gt; click install."
