The experimenter had five different smoked water treatments for assisting the germination of *Banksia* seeds. She had 50 dishes on which she could place seeds randomly selected from a uniform batch of *Banksia* seeds. The dishes were to be placed on the bench and each of the five water solutions allocated randomly to 10 of the dishes. \n\n### Question 1.1\n*(i)*\tWhat would the degrees of freedom be in a corresponding ANOVA table? \n\n::: {.content-visible when-profile=\"solution\"}\n\n### Solution {style=\"color:green;\"}\n\n* Treatment df = t – 1 = 5 – 1\t=  4\n\n* Residual df =\tN – t = 50 – 5\t= 45\n\n* Total df = N – 1 = 50 – 1\t= 49\n\n:::\n\n### Question 1.2\n*(ii)*\tSuppose that Treatment 1 was a control.  In situations where the comparisons of interest are of the other treatments (2 to 5) with the control, and not amongst the other treatments, it can be advantageous to increase the number of control replicates to 20. What are the degrees of freedom in the corresponding ANOVA table?\n\n::: {.content-visible when-profile=\"solution\"}\n\n### Solution {style=\"color:green;\"}\n\n* Treatment df = t – 1 = 5 – 1\t=  4\n\n* Residual df =\tN – t = 60 – 5\t= 55\n\n* Total df = N – 1 = 60 – 1\t= 59\n\n:::\n\n### Question 1.3\n*(iii)* The formula for standard error of the difference (SED) is:\n\n$SED=\\sqrt{Resid\\ MS\\left(\\frac{1}{n_1}+\\frac{1}{n_2}\\right)}$.\n\nGiven the SED formula, what percentage improvement (i.e. reduction) has been achieved for the SED between Treatment 1 and 2 when there are equal replicates *(i)* versus unequal replicates *(ii)*?  Assume the Residual MS is a constant.\n\n::: {.content-visible when-profile=\"solution\"}\n\n### Solution {style=\"color:green;\"}\nFor the equal replicate design:\n\n$SED=\\sqrt{Resid\\ MS\\left(\\frac{1}{10}+\\frac{1}{10}\\right)}\\approx0.447\\times\\sqrt{Resid\\ MS}$.  \n\nFor the second design:\n\n$SED=\\sqrt{Resid\\ MS\\left(\\frac{1}{20}+\\frac{1}{10}\\right)}\\approx0.387\\times\\sqrt{Resid\\ MS}$.\n\nSo SED(extra control rep) / SED(equal rep) = 0.387 / 0.447 = 0.866, i.e. a 13.4% reduction in the SED.\n\n:::\n\n## Exercise 2 - The balance between the number of sampling units and experimental units (Walk-through)\nHorticulturalists have been studying the nutrient requirements of lettuce growing in a sand medium; in particular they are looking at the nitrate concentration in leaf petioles in response to varying applied nitrogen nutrient levels (5, 11, 18 and 32 mmol/L).  Lettuce plants are grown in separate pots, so different nitrogen levels may be applied to individual pots, and one or more leaves sampled per plant.  They are also interested in optimising their experimental protocol for future studies; consequently they conducted five separate experiments where they sampled different number of leaves per plant, and differing number of plants, but kept the total number of leaves sampled at 128 in each experiment.  The experiments were conducted as follows:\n\n* Experiment 1:  16 leaves per plant; 2 plants per treatment;\n\n* Experiment 2:  8 leaves per plant; 4 plants per treatment;\n\n* Experiment 3:  4 leaves per plant; 8 plants per treatment;\n\n* Experiment 4:  2 leaves per plant; 16 plants per treatment;\n\n* Experiment 5:  1 leaf per plant; 32 plants per treatment.\n\nSimilar lettuce plants were used across all five experiments, and in all cases, a CRD was used to allocate the plants amongst the treatments.  The datasets are located in the *Data5.xlsx* file.  There are separate sheets for each Experiment called *Experiment1*, *Experiment2*, etc.\n\n### Question 2.1\n*(i)* What are the experimental units and what are the sampling units in the above experiments.  For each experiment, how many experimental units and how many sampling units are used?\n\n::: {.content-visible when-profile=\"solution\"}\n\n### Solution {style=\"color:green;\"}\n\nThe experimental unit is the plant, and the sampling unit is the leaf on the plant.  All experiments have 128 sampling units (leaves).  However, the number of experimental units varies, and is: Experiment 1: 8; Experiment 2: 16; Experiment 3: 32; Experiment 4: 64; and Experiment 5: 128.\n\n:::\n\n### Question 2.2\n*(ii)* When there are multiple sampling units per experimental unit, in simple situations (as is here), an appropriate method is simply to average the responses over all the sampling units belonging to an experimental unit, and analyse these.  So in this case, we need to average the observed nitrate values over all the leaves in the plant.  The code below shows how to do this using a function called `rowMeans` which finds the average in a row across multiple columns.  Here we do this for *Experiment1*.   \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# \n```\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.content-visible when-profile=\"solution\"}\n### Solution {style=\"color:green;\"}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(readxl)\nexp1<-read_excel(\"Data5.xlsx\",sheet=\"Experiment1\")\nexp1$treatment<-as.factor(exp1$treatment)\nexp1$response<-rowMeans(exp1[,3:18])\nstr(exp1)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\ntibble [8 × 19] (S3: tbl_df/tbl/data.frame)\n $ treatment: Factor w/ 4 levels \"N1\",\"N2\",\"N3\",..: 1 1 2 2 3 3 4 4\n $ plant    : num [1:8] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\n $ leaf1    : num [1:8] 2.46 1.73 3.31 2.49 2.4 2.6 3.06 2.23\n $ leaf2    : num [1:8] 2.45 1.3 2.5 2.73 2.56 2.42 1.95 2.39\n $ leaf3    : num [1:8] 3.24 2.37 2.02 2.32 1.67 2.48 2.38 2.69\n $ leaf4    : num [1:8] 2.36 1.46 1.97 1.54 1.78 2.3 1.93 2.4\n $ leaf5    : num [1:8] 3.17 1.52 2.46 2.5 2 2.09 1.32 1.74\n $ leaf6    : num [1:8] 2.87 1.99 1.52 2.62 3.32 1.66 1.87 2.84\n $ leaf7    : num [1:8] 2.39 2.79 2.07 2.71 1.75 2.46 2.42 2.36\n $ leaf8    : num [1:8] 2.94 2.03 1.68 1.92 2.49 2.68 2.22 3.3\n $ leaf9    : num [1:8] 2.76 2.23 2.68 3.07 2.21 2.07 2.38 1.62\n $ leaf10   : num [1:8] 3 2.17 1.45 2.48 2.33 1.75 2.76 1.82\n $ leaf11   : num [1:8] 2.54 2.74 1.96 2.15 1.46 2.61 2.04 3.03\n $ leaf12   : num [1:8] 3.19 1.36 2.26 2.73 2.2 2.63 2.07 3.66\n $ leaf13   : num [1:8] 3.03 1.45 1.94 2.22 1.61 2.08 2.09 4.03\n $ leaf14   : num [1:8] 2.42 1.19 2.38 2.37 2.6 3.44 2.18 1.59\n $ leaf15   : num [1:8] 2.68 1.12 2.66 1.75 1.3 2.46 2.18 2.81\n $ leaf16   : num [1:8] 2.56 0.77 1.85 1.49 1.61 2.5 1.95 2.27\n $ response : num [1:8] 2.75 1.76 2.17 2.32 2.08 ...\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n:::\n\n### Question 2.3\n\n*(iii)* Perform a one-way ANOVA on these average data.

However, there is evidence that only sampling one leaf per plant results in a moderate decline in the significance levels.  These findings are seen when either the Residual MS, F or P-values are used to make this assessment.  So for this scheme, it would be recommended to use Experiment 3 or Experiment 4 protocols.

So Experiment 1 might be optimal here (but this would give the very minimal level of replication, so for a cautionary approach, Experiment 2 might be used).\n\n:::\n\n## Exercise 3 - A paired t-test generalises to a one-way ANOVA – RCBD\nFifteen farms cooperated in a field trial in which a normal fattening ration for pigs (ration A) was compared with the same rations supplemented with a small trace of copper (ration B).  Each farmer set up two pens of pigs, as similar as possible in all respects, and allocated the two rations at random, ration A to one pen and ration B to the other.  The mean weight gains per pen (g/day) are stored in the two columns of the **copper** sheet in the **Data5.xlsx** file.\n\nThis description clearly suggests the design is an RCBD, with 15 farms but only 2 treatments.  As we have seen, a paired design is the simplest form of RCBD.  In this example we will not worry about model assumptions.\n\n### Question 3.1\n\n*(i)* Firstly analyse the data using a paired t-test.  Assuming you read the data is as a data frame called `copper` the code is `t.test(x=copper$RationA,y=copper$RationB,paired=T)`.

To do this analysis however, you will first need to re-arrange the data set into a form suitable for ANOVA.  That is, you will need a single column of weight gains, a column of treatment identifiers, and a column indicating the Farm number.  The code below will do this for you:\n\n* `dat<-stack(copper[,2:3])`\n\n* `farms<-rep(c(1:15),times=2)`\n\n* `coppern<-cbind(farms,dat)`\n\nThe first line stacks (using the `stack` function) the 2 columns of weight gain on top of each other (column name is `values`) and adds a column indicating which ration is associated with each weight gain value (column name is `ind`).\n\nThe second line repeats (using the `rep` function) the values of farm numbers twice so for each of the weight gains we have an associated farm.\n\nThe third line joins the two data frames together (using the `cbind` function) to create the new stacked dataset which can be used by the `aov` function.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhead(copper)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 6 × 3\n   Farm RationA RationB\n  <dbl>   <dbl>   <dbl>\n1     1     422     531\n2     2     526     467\n3     3     476     558\n4     4     499     585\n5     5     422     472\n6     6     503     522\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndat<-stack(copper[,2:3])\nfarms<-rep(c(1:15),times=2)\ncoppern<-cbind(farms,dat)\nstr(coppern)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n'data.frame':\t30 obs. of  3 variables:\n $ farms : int  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ...\n $ values: num  422 526 476 499 422 503 445 449 299 517 ...\n $ ind   : Factor w/ 2 levels \"RationA\",\"RationB\": 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n### Question 3.3\n\n*(iii)* The general code for performing an 1-way anova with a randomised complete block design is:\n\n`aov(response~block+treatment,data=data)` \n\nIn this example the `response` is the weight gain, `blocks` are farms and the `treatment` is ration. Your names will be different.  Having obtained the analysis, check that the results from the ANOVA is identical to the paired t-test:\n\n* the same *P*-value;\n\n* the same test statistic (though expressed as an *F*-statistic instead of a *t*-statistic, with *F* = $t^2$ to that from the paired *t*-test.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# \n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n::: {.content-visible when-profile=\"solution\"}\n### Solution {style=\"color:green;\"}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nblock.anova<-aov(values~as.factor(farms)+ind,data=coppern)\nanova(block.anova)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nAnalysis of Variance Table\n\nResponse: values\n                 Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value   Pr(>F)   \nas.factor(farms) 14  71524  5108.9   4.306 0.004963 **\nind               1  12567 12566.5  10.592 0.005761 **\nResiduals        14  16610  1186.5                    \n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nComparisons with paired t-test.\n\n* P = 0.006 in both analyses\n\n* $t^2$ =  $(–3.25)^2$ = 10.59 = F  \n\n* Residual df = 14 = df for t-test\n\n:::\n\n## Exercise 4 - One-way ANOVA - RCBD\n\nThree diets for hamsters were tested for differences in weight gain after a specified period of time. Six inbred lines were used with three hamsters selected from each line. The three diets were assigned at random to the hamsters in each line.  The data is in the **hamsters** sheet in the **Data5.xlsx** file.\n\n### Question 4.1  \n\n*(i)* Are the mean weight gains the same across diets? Are any diets more or less effective than other diets? You will need to use the `emmeans` package and its `emmeans()` function. Read in the data and perform post-hoc tests.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# \n```\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.content-visible when-profile=\"solution\"}\n### Solution {style=\"color:green;\"}\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(readxl)\nhamster<-read_excel(\"Data5.xlsx\",sheet=\"hamster\")\nhead(hamster)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 6 × 3\n  Inbred_Line Wt_Gain  Diet\n  <chr>         <dbl> <dbl>\n1 A                18     1\n2 B                16     1\n3 C                17     1\n4 D                19     1\n5 E                12     1\n6 F                13     1\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhamster$Diet<-as.factor(hamster$Diet)\nhamster$Inbred_Line<-as.factor(hamster$Inbred_Line)\nblock.anova<-aov(Wt_Gain~Inbred_Line+Diet,data=hamster)\nanova(block.anova)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nAnalysis of Variance Table\n\nResponse: Wt_Gain\n            Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value   Pr(>F)   \nInbred_Line  5 71.167  14.233  7.4912 0.003650 **\nDiet         2 36.333  18.167  9.5614 0.004773 **\nResiduals   10 19.000   1.900                    \n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nPerform post-hoc tests.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(emmeans)\nemmeans(block.anova, pairwise ~ Diet)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n$emmeans\n Diet emmean    SE df lower.CL upper.CL\n 1      15.8 0.563 10     14.6     17.1\n 2      13.0 0.563 10     11.7     14.3\n 3      12.7 0.563 10     11.4     13.9\n\nResults are averaged over the levels of: Inbred_Line \nConfidence level used: 0.95 \n\n$contrasts\n contrast      estimate    SE df t.ratio p.value\n Diet1 - Diet2    2.833 0.796 10   3.560  0.0131\n Diet1 - Diet3    3.167 0.796 10   3.979  0.0067\n Diet2 - Diet3    0.333 0.796 10   0.419  0.9087\n\nResults are averaged over the levels of: Inbred_Line \nP value adjustment: tukey method for comparing a family of 3 estimates \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nThere are significant differences in mean weigh gain of hamsters amongst the three diets (F = 9.56; df = 2, 10; P = 0.005).  Based on the post-hoc tests, hamsters fed diet 1 had a significantly higher weight gain than those fed diets 2 or 3, whereas there was no significant difference between weights for hamsters on Diets 2 and 3.\n\n:::\n\n### Question 4.2  \n*(ii)* Re-run the analysis without blocking, i.e. as a CRD.  Are the conclusions different?  Would you use blocking in the future?  What proportion of the variation was explained by blocking?\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# \n```\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.content-visible when-profile=\"solution\"}\n### Solution {style=\"color:green;\"}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncrd.anova<-aov(Wt_Gain~Diet,data=hamster)\nanova(crd.anova)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nAnalysis of Variance Table\n\nResponse: Wt_Gain\n          Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value  Pr(>F)  \nDiet       2 36.333 18.1667  3.0222 0.07892 .\nResiduals 15 90.167  6.0111                  \n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nWe now have a non-significant F-test.  Based on Block SS in the original analysis value of 71.167, we can see that the majority of the Residual SS (90.167) in the CRD is from the between-block differences.  By including the block effect through the RCBD we have dramatically reduced the Residual SS.\n\nThe proportion of variation explained by the Blocking is:\n\n$\\frac{Block\\ SS}{Total\\ SS}=\\frac{71.167}{126.5}=0.56$.\n\nTherefore 56% of the variation in the response is explained by the blocking.  This is compelling evidence for using blocking in future versions of the experiment.\n\n:::\n\n",
