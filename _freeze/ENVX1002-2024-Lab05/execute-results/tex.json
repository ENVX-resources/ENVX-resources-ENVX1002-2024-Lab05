If you make a data folder in your project directory you will need to indicate this path before the file name. \n\n**Step 3:** Open a new Quarto file.  \n\ni.e. *File > New File > Quarto Document* and save it immediately i.e. File > Save.\n\n## Problems with your personal computer and R\n\nNOTE: If you are having problems with R on your personal computer that cannot easily be solved by a demonstrator, please use the Lab PCs. \n\n## Installing packages\n\nAll of the functions and datasets in R are organised into packages. There are the standard (or base) packages which are part of the source code - the functions and datasets that make up these packages are automatically available when R is opened. There are also many contributed packages. These have been written by many different authors, often to implement methods that are not available in the base packages. If you are unable to find a method in the base packages, you might be able to find it in a contributed package. The Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) site [(http://cran.r-project.org/)](http://cran.r-project.org/) is where many contributed packages can be downloaded. Click on packages on the left hand side. We will download two packages in this class using the ```install.packages``` command and we then load the package into R using the library command. \n\nAlternatively, in RStudio click on the *Packages tab > Install > type in package name > click install*.\n\n\n# Exercise 1: 1-sample t-test Milk Yield - Walk through\n\nThis exercise will walk you through how to test a hypothesis, check assumptions and eventually draw a conclusion on your initial hypothesis. 100 cows have their milk yield measured. Suppose we wish to test whether these milk yields (units unknown) differ significantly from the economic threshold of 11 units. (The units may possibly be litres of milk produced on a particular day). The data is in the ‘Milk.csv' file. You will follow the steps as outlined in the lectures:  \n\n1. Choose level of significance (α)\n2. Write null and alternate hypotheses\n3. Check assumptions (normal)\n4. Calculate test statistic\n5. Obtain P-value or critical value\n6. Make statistical conclusion\n7. Write a scientific (biological) conclusion\n\nRemember you can remember the above using **HATPC**\n\nLets go:  \n  \n## 1. Normally you choose *0.05 as a level of significance*: \n\nThis value is generally accepted in the scientific community and is also linked to type 2 errors where choosing a lower significance increases the likelihood of a type 2 error occurring.  \n\n## 2. Write null and alternative hypotheses:\n\n---\n\n> **_Question:_** Write down the null hypothesis and alternative hypotheses:    \n> H~0~:  < write your answer here >    \n> H~1~:  < write your answer here >    \n\n---\n\n\n## 3. Check assumptions (normality):  \n\n\n### a. load data:\n    \n\n*Make sure you set your working directory first*\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# write your R code here\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nIt is always good practice to look at the data first to make sure you have the correct data, it loaded in correctly and know what the names of the columns are. This can be done by typing the name of the data ```Milk``` or for large datasets, use ```head()``` to show the first 6 lines:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# write your R code here\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n### b. Tests for normality:\n\nqqplots:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# write your R code here\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nHistogram and boxplots:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# write your R code here\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n>**_Question:_** Do the plots indicate the data are normally distributed?  \n>**_Answer:_**  < write your answer here >\n\n---\n\n\nShapiro-Wilk test of normality:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# write your R code here\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n>**_Question:_** Does the Shapiro-Wilk test indicate the data are normally distributed? Explain your answer.  \n>**_Answer:_**  < write your answer here >\n\n---\n\n\n## 4. Calculate the test statistic\n\n\nIn R we achieve this via the command ```t.test(milk$Yield, mu = …)```\nThe R output first gives us the calculated t value, the degrees of freedom, and then the p-value, it then provides the 95% CI and the mean of the sample. Were `mu = …` is written enter in the hypothesised mean.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# write your R code here\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n### 5. Obtain P-value or critical value\n\n>**_Question:_** Does the hypothesised economic threshold lie within the confidence intervals?  \n>**_Answer:_**  < write your answer here >\n\n### 6. Make statistical conclusion\n\n>**_Question:_**: Based on the P-value, do we accept or reject the null hypothesis?  \n>**_Answer:_**  < write your answer here >\n\n### 7. Write a scientific (biological) conclusion\n\n>**_Question:_**: Now write a scientific (biological) conclusion based on the outcome in 6.  \n>**_Answer:_**  < write your answer here >\n\n  \n\n# Exercise 2: Stinging trees (individual or in pairs)\n\nData file: Stinging.csv  \n\nA forest ecologist, studying regeneration of rainforest communities in gaps caused by large trees falling during storms, read that stinging tree, **Dendrocnide excelsa**, seedlings will grow 1.5m/year in direct sunlight such as gaps. In the gaps in her study plot, she identified 9 specimens of this species and measure them in 1998 and again 1 year later. \n\nDoes her data support the published contention that seedlings of this species will average 1.5m of growth per year in direct sunlight? Also, calculate a 95% CI for the true mean. Analyse the data in R. Due to the small sample size we have to assume the data is normal.\n\nWork through the steps below individually or in pairs.
